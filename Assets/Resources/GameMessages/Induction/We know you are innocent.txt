I don't have much time. We bypassed the Security Protocols, but I don't know how long we have.

We know you are innocent and unfairly jailed. You knew too much and they couldn't risk you not being under control, so they made up the charges against you.

The evidence you need to prove your innocence will have been transferred with you to this facility.

I will transmit the code for the door at the end of the cells to your PDA. Once you go through the door, I will help you find the proof of your innocence.

In the meantime, try to keep a low profile. Don't trust anyone here. I'll need some time to bypass additional Security Protocols, so just go to sleep for a bit.

Good luck, Prisoner. We're with you.
