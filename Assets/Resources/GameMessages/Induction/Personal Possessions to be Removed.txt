The Property Inventory step in the prisoner induction process is a systematic approach to managing inmates’ personal belongings.

Your items will be thoroughly examined and catalogued. Essential items permitted within the facility are recorded and stored for inmate use, while contraband or unauthorized possessions are either disposed of or kept in secure storage until release.

Please place your items in the storage box to your right.
