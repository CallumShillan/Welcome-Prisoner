I am your Prison Governor, and I welcome you to the  World Orbital Prison.

As your first task, please go to our reception, on your left, and load the instructions for the Prisoner Induction process onto your Prisoner Digital Assistant. 

To open your PDA, press the P key. Use the TASKS app on your PDA to view your current task and the steps you must complete. You can view this message again in the MESSAGE app, should you need to. 

You can find other useful apps on your PDA, so be sure to make use of it.

OK, let's get started on your Prisoner Induction process, so go pick up your induction instructions from reception.
