The World Orbital Prison is run on behalf of the United Earth Federation and is subject to the Universal Civil Liberties legislation.

In keeping with this legislation, an Induction Process is used so all prisoners are absorbed into the prison in a uniform manner.

The induction process is:
	Identification: Prisoners have their bioemtrics taken for identification purposes.
	Medical Check: A thorough medical examination is conducted to assess the prisoner’s health and identify any immediate medical needs.
	Property Inventory: Personal items that are allowed in the facility are inventoried, and prohibited items are stored or disposed of.
	Assignment: Each prisoner is assigned to a cell or dormitory based on their security classification and needs assessment.
