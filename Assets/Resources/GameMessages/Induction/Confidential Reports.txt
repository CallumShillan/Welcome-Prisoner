<b>CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS</b>
Why am I so forgetful, nowdays?

I know it's a breach of security to record folder passcodes, but I can't afford to lose this job. So I'm going to take a risk with the Confidential Reports folder for our most high profile prisoners.

The Confidential Reports can be found in the <b>PDA DOCUMENTS</b> app and they are held in the <b>SECURITY</b> folder. The password for this folder is <b><color="red">7765</color></b>.
