Thank you, Prisoner.

Your Induction Process is now complete.

To recap: you have your Identity Card, and this is logged as you open doors so your movements are tracked around the facility. Your personal possessions were removed and are held in the Storage Room awaiting transfer to our Central Storage Facility. Finally, you have undergone a Medical Check, and no problems were found.

Please make yourself comfortable in your cell. As you are the first inmate, you have been assigned Cell #1. You will be assigned work duties shortly, and you will be informed of these via your PDA.

Remember that you can use your PDA at any time by pressing the "P" key.

Please make your way to your cell.
