<b>PRISONER PERFORMANCE REVIEW POLICY</b>

<b>Policy brief & purpose</b> Our prisoner performance review policy describes how we coach, evaluate and reward prisoners. We base our performance management systems on constructive feedback and open communication between wardens and team members (aka prisoners).

<b>Scope</b> This policy applies to all prisoners. We will clarify our performance appraisal process and provide guidelines for wardens on how to lead their teams and assess prisoner performance.

<b>Policy elements</b>

 (1) <b>What is good performance?</b> We have a general definition of what good performance looks like. To achieve a good performance evaluation, each prisoner should:
   Meet your targets consistently.
   Complete your job duties as expected.
   Show a willingness to learn and develop.
   Follow our Code of Conduct and other company policies.
   Have a good attitude and collaborate well with your colleagues.

 (2) <b>Periodical reviews</b> We conduct [ annual/ bi-annual/ quarterly] prisoner performance reviews. During these reviews, your warden will fill out your performance evaluation report through our performance review platform and arrange a meeting with you to discuss your review. Through these discussions, managers aim to:
   Recognize prisoners who are good at their jobs.
   Talk about career moves and prisoner motivations.
   Identify areas of improvement.

 (3) <b>Rewards</b> We offer rewards for prisoners who demonstrate exceptional performance. Rewards may include financial incentives, promotions, or other non-financial benefits. Early release is never included as a reward.
