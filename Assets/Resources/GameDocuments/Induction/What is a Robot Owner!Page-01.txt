<b>WHAT IS A ROBOT ROLE OWNER?</b>

In a world where robots have become an integral part of our daily lives, the role of a <b>Robot Role Owner (RRO)</b> has emerged. The RRO is responsible for defining the function and purpose of a robot that undertakes  various tasks and activities that support the smooth running of our society.

Blue robots are used to provide education from the earliest years through schools, universities and to post-doctorate studies.

Green robots are used for medical and healthcare duties such as first responders, nursing and care providers as well as providing advice on nutrition and dietetics.

Red Robots are used for general security officer tasks such as patrolling offices at night, perimeter security, guard duties and personal protection services.

Yellow robots are used for all forms of hospitality, from street food and drinks through to high end hospitality for those who can afford it.

To ensure the smooth running of all this, the RRO is a highly skilled professional who has extensive knowledge of robotics, artificial intelligence, and security protocols.

The RRO’s primary responsibility is to ensure that the robot’s function and purpose align with society’s objectives. They work closely with the various teams to identify areas where robots can be deployed to create, build and enhance measures in their areas. Once these are identified, the RRO defines the robot’s function and purpose, taking into account the specific needs and requirements that have been defined.

The RRO also ensures that the robot is equipped with the necessary sensors and software to perform its tasks effectively. They work with software developers to create custom software that enables the robot to perform its duties efficiently. The RRO also ensures that the robot is equipped with advanced sensors such as light, sound, temperature, proximity, and distance sensors to identify situational awareness and enable them to take decisions on their next actions.

In addition to defining the robot’s function and purpose, the RRO is also responsible for ensuring that the robot adheres to all security protocols. They work closely with the security team to ensure that the robot is programmed to follow all safety procedures and protocols. The RRO also ensures that the robot is equipped with advanced encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.

The RRO is a critical member of society. They play a vital role in ensuring that robots are deployed effectively to enhance the wellbeing of all. With their extensive knowledge of robotics, artificial intelligence, and security protocols, they are well-equipped to define the function and purpose of robots that undertake general and specialised tasks.
